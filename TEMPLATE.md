## Developer
- **Name**: Fey
- **GitHub**: @Feymarl
- **Discord**: fey no limit
- **Experience**: My first exposure to Web3 came in 2021, when the world was buzzing about NFTs. Initially, I was simply curious, as friends in the design community often shared their work on marketplaces like OpenSea. I then tried creating my first digital wallet, MetaMask. Honestly, it felt like opening the door to a new world—everything was transparent, without banks, or third parties.

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Game Bell
- **Category**: gaming

### Description
Game Bell is an NFT-based play-to-earn game where players can collect, trade, and use NFT assets within the gameplay. All progress and item ownership are stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and true digital ownership for players.

### SL Integration  
For Interoperability:
Game Bell leverages the Soundness Layer (SL) to ensure seamless interoperability with other vApps and zkApps in the ecosystem. By using wallet integration on SL, players can use the same identity and assets across multiple decentralized applications without the need to re-register or duplicate data.

## Technical

### Architecture
1. Client (Game App): Web/mobile-based game interface.
2. NFT Smart Contract: Represents items, characters, or in-game assets.
3. Wallet Integration (Soundness Layer): Players log in and transact directly through their wallet connected to the Soundness Layer.
4. On-chain Game Logic: Actions such as battles, item upgrades, and rewards are processed on the Soundness Layer testnet.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React (for web-based game UI, fast rendering, and responsive components)
- **Backend**: Node.js (for handling game logic off-chain, APIs, and server-side integration)
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (SL) for wallet integration and on-chain game logic, with optional Ethereum/Polygon bridges for NFT marketplace interoperability
- **Storage**: IPFS (for decentralized storage of game assets/metadata), plus WALRUS for scalable and persistent data availability

### Features
1. NFT-based Assets – Players can collect, own, and trade in-game items and characters as NFTs, ensuring verifiable on-chain ownership.
2. Play-to-Earn Mechanics – Players are rewarded with tokens or NFTs based on gameplay achievements, battles, and progression.
3. Wallet Integration – Seamless login and transaction handling through Soundness Layer wallets, enabling interoperability with other vApps.

## Timeline

### PoC (1-2 weeks)
Week 1:
Project setup, basic NFT contract.
Wallet integration with the Soundness Layer testnet.
Week 2:
Implementation of core play-to-earn mechanics.
Internal testing + PoC documentation.

## Innovation
Game Bell stands out by combining seamless wallet integration on the Soundness Layer with a fun and accessible play-to-earn model. Unlike many NFT games that require complex onboarding or expensive initial purchases, Game Bell focuses on easy entry for new players and true interoperability:
Low barrier to entry: Players can start playing with minimal cost, lowering adoption friction.
Cross-app interoperability: Assets earned in Game Bell are portable and can be used or traded across other SL-based vApps.
Sustainable play-to-earn: Rewards are designed around engagement and skill, not just speculation, making the economy healthier for long-term use.
By addressing onboarding challenges and ensuring assets have value beyond the game itself, Game Bell creates a unique, community-driven ecosystem that players will want to join and stay engaged with.
